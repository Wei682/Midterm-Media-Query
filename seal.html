			<h3> History </h3>
			<p> Back in the Shang dynasty, in order to make sure that important documents were not tampered during transportation, a specific seal was applied to the clay before it dried. Later, complex seals were used for proclaiming political authenticity of documents.</p>

			<p> Seal engraving is a traditional Chinese technique to create seals. It has been included on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage list since 2008. According to UNESCO, to engrave a seal, the design is initially sketched on paper, and then carved on stone in reverse by a knife. In addition to mastery of traditional calligraphy, seal engravers need to have a high degree of virtuosity, since every curve and every thickness of line counts.</p>
