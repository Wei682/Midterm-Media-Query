			<p id = "inkPaintingHistory"> Ink wash painting was created in the Tang dynasty (618-907). As it developed, two distinct styles were identified in the Ming dynastry (1368-1644): a clearer, grander Northern School and a freer, more expressive Southern School.</p>

			<h3> Technique </h3>
			<!-- Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ink_wash_painting -->
			<p> Ink wash painting achieves tonal variations and shading by controlling the ink and water ratio and the pressure within each single brushstroke. A traditional black stroke can produce colors ranging from deep black to silvery gray.</p>
			
			<h3> Philosophy </h3>
			<!-- Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ink_wash_painting -->
			<p> Ink wash painting emphasizes on capturing the spirit over reproducing the appearance. For example, to paint a horse, it is more important for the artist to understand its temperament better than its muscles and bones. For another instance, when painting a flower, it's not necessary to perfectly replicate its petals and colors; instead, it's crucial to convey its liveliness and fragrance. This emphasis is associated with the Ch√°n or Zen sect of Buddhism, which emphasizes "simplicity, spontaneity and self-expression", and Daoism, which focuses "spontaneity and harmony with nature". </p>
