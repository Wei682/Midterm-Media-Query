			<h2> Bamboo Weaving </h2>
			<!-- Reference: https://medium.com/@zepboo/the-origin-and-future-of-bamboo-weaving-products-ff728da2dc7f -->
			<h3> Origin </h3>
			<p> The origin of bamboo weaving can be traced back to ancient China. The character “bamboo” was first recorded during the Neolithic period, around 6000 years ago, at the Yangshao culture site in Banpo Village, Xi’an. During the Zhou Dynasty, bamboo was used in royal garden construction. During the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States Period, people made bamboo tools called “ju” and used bamboo tubes to lift water for irrigation, greatly improving agricultural technology. During this period, bamboo was also widely used in military applications, with bamboo bows and arrows being the main weapons at the time.</p>
