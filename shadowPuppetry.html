			<h3> History </h3>
			<p> Shadow Puppetry is said to have originated in China over two thousand years ago during the Han Dynasty. The origin tale recounts the story of Emperor Han Wudi, who was deeply grieved by the sudden death of his beloved concubine. As an Emperor’s wise advisor pondered the best way to revive the Emperor’s spirits, he came upon children playing in the courtyard with parasols under the midday sun. Their simple parasols cast shadows that were so lifelike, he was struck with an illuminating idea. That night, he arranged a performance for the Emperor in the courtyard, where he skillfully created the likeness of the late Empress using shadows. After watching this, the Emperor was deeply moved and revived. </p>
