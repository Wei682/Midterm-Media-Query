					<p> The market for Chinese arts and crafts has been growing. Some individuals propose that for the market to further expand, Chinese artisans should alter their methods and encourage young people to explore their creativity, in addition to learning the craft. Artisans can also incorporate contemporary elements to appeal to a wider modern market.</p>
