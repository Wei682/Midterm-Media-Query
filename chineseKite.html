			<h3> History </h3>
			<p> The first kite was invented by Mo Tze (墨子 [mò zǐ]), who lived in the Spring and Autumn period (770–476 BC). He spent three years making a bird-shaped gadget with wood, but his kite could only fly for one day. Then Lǔ Bān (鲁班), an excellent artisan during the Spring and Autumn Period, improved Mo Tze’ product. He used bamboo to craft the kite, which could soar in the sky for three days. That’s the embryonic form of modern kites.</p>

			<h3> Usage </h3>
			<p> Kites were first used in military war to convey information, detect the situation, or carry explosives. During the Tang Dynasty (618–907 AD), kites transitioned from being primarily used as weapons to becoming popular toys for entertainment. At that prosperous period, paper making got great development, people produced kites with paper and bamboo strips to lessen the weight. It was more convenient to carry. Since then, flying kites became a popular way of entertaining oneself, friends and kids. </p>

			<p> After flying kites become a way of having fun, the shape of kites was no longer restricted to birds anymore. The shapes and patterns range from Chinese zodiac animals to facial portraits of opera characters, people's aspirations, depictions of Buddha, and historical figures. </p>
